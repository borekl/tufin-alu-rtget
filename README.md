# ALCATEL SR7750 ROUTING INFORMATION SCRAPER FOR TUFIN

This script uses Expect perl module to log into a Alcate-Lucent SR 7750
routers and retrieve routing and interface information and then outputs
it in a format suitable for import into Tufin Orchestration Suite.

Written and tested with TiMOS-C-12.0.R6 on SR7750.
